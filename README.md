# js-notes

## Welcome to the **js-notes** wiki!

This is an attempt to be a guide to **those JavaScript concepts** that are most fashionable on the web.
This is not a guide to help others but a few friends and my brother, so _keep it secret, keep it safe_.

Any help, review, comments, will be welcome anyway.
